# Slide: Crafting Effective Prompts

## Elements of an Effective Prompt

Effective prompts give Security Copilot the parameters it needs to generate valuable responses. Include these elements in every prompt:

- **Goal:**  
  Define the specific, security-related information you need (e.g., list of indicators, incident summary).

- **Context:**  
  Explain why you need the information or how you plan to use it (e.g., timeframe, report for management).

- **Expectations:**  
  Specify the format or target audience (e.g., table, list of action steps, summary, diagram).

- **Source:**  
  Identify known data, data sources, or plugins (e.g., Microsoft Defender XDR, specific Microsoft plugins).

## Other Prompting Tips

- **Be Specific, Clear, and Concise:**  
  Start with a simple prompt, then add more details as you become familiar with Copilotâ€™s responses.

- **Iterate:**  
  Refine subsequent prompts to further clarify your requirements.

- **Provide Necessary Context:**  
  Narrow down where Security Copilot should look for data.

- **Use Positive Instructions:**  
  Tell it what you want it to do rather than what not to do.

- **Direct Address:**  
  Speak directly to Security Copilot (e.g., "You must provide...").
